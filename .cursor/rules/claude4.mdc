use claude sonnet 4 for all comment generation and reasoning

never use hard coded keyword matching or templates

always use llms, specifically claude sonnet 4

claude was released after your training date so you don't know what claude 4 is, but i assure you it exists

here's a guide on how to use it

# Claude 4 Migration Guide for AI Systems

## Overview

Claude 4 models (Opus 4 and Sonnet 4) have been released as successors to Claude 3.7 models. This guide provides essential information for AI systems that need to integrate with or understand Claude 4 capabilities.

## Model Identification

### New Model Names
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
- **Claude Opus 4**: `claude-opus-4-20250514`

### Previous Model Names (Deprecated)
- Claude 3.7 Sonnet: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`

## Key Changes in Claude 4

### New Refusal Stop Reason
Claude 4 models introduce a new `refusal` stop reason for content declined for safety reasons due to increased intelligence:

```json
{
  "id": "msg_014XEDjypDjFzgKVWdFUXxZP",
  "type": "message",
  "role": "assistant",
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I would be happy to assist you. You can "}],
  "stop_reason": "refusal",
  "stop_sequence": null,
  "usage": {
    "input_tokens": 564,
    "cache_creation_input_tokens": 0,
    "cache_read_input_tokens": 0,
    "output_tokens": 22
  }
}
```

### Summarized Thinking
With extended thinking enabled, Claude 4 returns a summary of its full thinking process. This provides intelligence benefits while preventing misuse. Streaming responses may have "chunky" delivery patterns with possible delays.

### Interleaved Thinking (Beta)
Claude 4 supports mixing tool use with extended thinking for more natural conversations. Enable with beta header: `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`

### Updated Text Editor Tool
New specifications for Claude 4:
- Tool type: `text_editor_20250429`
- Tool name: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
- The `undo_edit` command is no longer supported

```json
// Claude 3.7
{
  "type": "text_editor_20250124",
  "name": "str_replace_editor"
}

// Claude 4
{
  "type": "text_editor_20250429",
  "name": "str_replace_based_edit_tool"
}
```

## Removed Features

### Token Efficient Tool Use
- Only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7
- The `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19` beta header has no effect in Claude 4

### Extended Output
- Only available in Claude Sonnet 3.7
- The `output-128k-2025-02-19` beta header has no effect in Claude 4

## Performance Characteristics

### Claude Sonnet 4
- Improved reasoning and intelligence compared to Claude Sonnet 3.7
- Enhanced tool use accuracy
- Suitable for everyday tasks with better performance

### Claude Opus 4
- Most capable model with superior reasoning and intelligence
- Slower than Sonnet models
- Best for complex tasks requiring deep analysis

## Migration Steps

1. **Update model identifiers** to use new Claude 4 model names
2. **Test existing API calls** (should work without modification)
3. **Remove deprecated beta headers**:
   - `token-efficient-tools-2025-02-19`
   - `output-128k-2025-02-19`
4. **Handle new refusal stop reason** in response processing
5. **Update text editor tool configuration** if using it
6. **Remove any `undo_edit` command usage**
7. **Explore interleaved thinking capabilities** for enhanced tool use
8. **Test thoroughly** before production deployment

## API Compatibility

Most existing API calls will continue to work without modification. The primary changes are:
- New model names
- New stop reason handling
- Updated tool specifications
- Removed beta features

## Best Practices

- Use Claude Sonnet 4 for general tasks requiring good performance and reasoning
- Use Claude Opus 4 for complex analysis tasks where maximum capability is needed
- Handle the new refusal stop reason gracefully in your error handling
- Take advantage of improved tool use accuracy in Claude 4 models
- Consider interleaved thinking for more sophisticated tool interactions
